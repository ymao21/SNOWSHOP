# SNOWSHOP

Welcome to SNOWSHOP! 

SNOWSHOP is a full-stack web application ecommerce website for my fellow winter sports lovers. It is a social ecommerce market place where users can buy and sell new and secondhand snowboards/skis, winter gears and accessories. It uses Express.js with a PostgresSQL database on the back-end, and React.js and Redux on the front-end. It uses Amazon Web Services foor image storage for users to upload products without concerning about storage issues.

## Inspiration:
I got into snowboarding thanks to discounted season passes from friends and their expert guidance. Now as an avid winter sports enthusiast myself, the idea of affordable winter sports gear was always at the back of my mind. The cost of gear and lessons can become a barrier for many aspiring snowboarders, so this site is a model of a platform that strives to make the sport more affordable and accessible. By offering budget-friendly used gears, and allowing users to upload/sell their used products creates an initiative to allow more people to enjoy/try the sport. 

SNOWSHOP is not only an application that replicates the functionality of an ecommerce website. It is also an approach or contribution to start building a more inclusive and passionate winter sports community.
